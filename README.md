Pairwise
========

This is my first Symfony project.
With this web application you can manage bills between two parties.

Once a User (with two partners) was added to the System and selected, you can create bills and make invoices.
The Invoice splits the bills between the two partners and shows which partner owns the other partner money.


Although most of the logic is implemented, there is still a lot of refactoring and testing to do.
Furthermore this app needs much bootstrap and css magic.
